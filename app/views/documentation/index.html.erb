    <h5 id="installation">Installation</h5>
    <p>The easiest way to install SlashDeploy is to use our Add to Slack button:</p>
    <p><%= add_to_slack %></p>
    <p>This allows us to automatically install the <code>/deploy</code> command as well as a <code>@slashdeploy</code> bot user, which is used to send you notifications when deployments start and end.</p>

    <hr />

    <h5 id="slash-command">Slash Command</h5>
    <p>Once SlashDeploy is installed into your Slack team, you'll have access to the <code>/deploy</code> command. The first time you type <code>/deploy</code> you'll be asked to authenticate with GitHub so that SlashDeploy can create GitHub Deployments on your behalf.</p>

    <hr />

    <h6>Deploying</h6>
    <p>To deploy the default ref (master) to the default environment (production).</p>
    <p><code>/deploy acme-inc/api</code></p>
    <p>To deploy the default ref (master) to a different environment.</p>
    <p><code>/deploy acme-inc/api to staging</code></p>
    <p>To deploy a branch (or git sha, or git tag) to the default environment.</p>
    <p><code>/deploy acme-inc/api@branch</code></p>
    <p>By default, all GitHub commit statuses will be checked before creating a deployment, you can disable this check by using the <code>!</code> flag.</p>
    <p><code>/deploy acme-inc/api@branch!</code></p>
    <p>To find out what environments you can deploy the repo to.</p>
    <p><code>/deploy where acme-inc/api</code></p>

    <hr />

    <h6>Locking</h6>
    <p>SlashDeploy also allows you to "lock" environments. If for example, I wanted to test a migration on the staging environment, I can lock it with a message.</p>
    <p><code>/deploy lock staging on acme-inc/api: I'm testing a migration</code></p>
    <p>If any of my other team members try to deploy to the staging environment, they'll see the lock message.</p>
    <p><code>/deploy acme-inc/api to staging</code></p>
    <p>When I'm done testing my changes, I can unlock the environment so others can deploy to it again.</p>
    <p><code>/deploy unlock staging on acme-inc/api</code></p>
    <p>When I'm done for the day, I can release all my locks.
    <p><code>/deploy unlock all</code></p>

    <h5 id=".slashdeploy.yml">.slashdeploy.yml</h5>

    <p>You may configure SlashDeploy for your project by putting a <a href="#.slashdeploy.yml">.slashdeploy.yml</a> file in the root of your git repository.
    <p>Here is a heavily commented <a href="#.slashdeploy.yml">.slashdeploy.yml</a> example:
      <pre>---
# teach SlashDeploy which environment is default. optional.
# used when environment is not passed to a `/deploy` command.
default_environment: production

# a document of available environments for this repository.
environments:

  # an environment named "production".
  production:

    # an optional list of aliases used to refer to the "production" environment.
    aliases:
      - prod

  # another environment named "stage".
  stage:
    aliases:
      - staging
    </pre>

    <hr />

    <h5 id="continuous-delivery">Continuous Delivery</h5>
    <p>You can configure SlashDeploy to automatically deploy a branch to an environment when you push code to GitHub.</p>
    <p>If you utilize Github "Branch Protection Rules", you should likely use the same set of "Require status checks" under <code>required_contexts</code>.</p>
    <p>This example <a href="#.slashdeploy.yml">.slashdeploy.yml</a> file will automatically deploy the <code>master</code> branch to the <code>production</code> environment, once tests are passing on CircleCI:</p>
    <p>
      <pre>---
environments:
  production:

    # Enable continuous delivery for this environment.
    continuous_delivery:

      # Specify any git "ref" (tag, branch, etc) to auto deploy when pushed to.
      ref: refs/heads/master
  
      # To deploy only after a set of GitHub commit statuses pass,
      # configure required_contexts (optional).
      required_contexts:
        - ci/circleci
      </pre>
    </p>

    <h5 id="faq">FAQ</h5>
    <dl>
      <dt>What's GitHub Deployments?</dt>
      <dd>In a nutshell, GitHub Deployments are a way to initialize a deployment <strong>request</strong> for a GitHub repository. It allows you to decouple the act of requesting a deployment, and the actual fullfillment. This allows you to have a consistent interface for performing deployments, whether it's a web app, infrastructure, native application, etc.</dd>
      <br />
      <dt>How does SlashDeploy know who I am on GitHub?</dt>
      <dd>When you first run the /deploy command, we ask you to authenticate with your GitHub account, which is then linked to your Slack user account.</dd>

    <h5 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h5>
    <p>Here we have some debugging information about the common issues and how to resolve them.
    <dl>
        <dt id="error-1">Error 1: <small>The deployment did not start</small></dt>
      <dd>If a deployment does not start in
      <%= time_ago_in_words(GithubDeploymentWatchdogWorker::DEFAULT_DELAY.from_now, include_seconds: true) %>, 
      you will get a Slack notification letting you know something went wrong. This might happen for a number of reasons, so check the following.
      <ul>
        <li>make sure the repo's <a href="#.slashdeploy.yml">.slashdeploy.yml</a> file is configured properly</li>
        <li>make sure the repo has a Github Deployment Integration (and Webhooks) to handle deployment events</li>
        <li>make sure the service handling the deployment events is working and sending Deployment Status updates to Github</li>
        <li>make sure the service handling the deployment events is not filtering or ignoring deployment requests. For example, it will deploy to <code>production</code>, however the  provided environment in the deployment event was <code>prod</code>.
      </dd>
      <dt id="error-2">Error 2: <small>A required commit status context is stuck in pending</small></dt>
      <dd>Inside the repo's <a href="#.slashdeploy.yml">.slashdeploy.yml</a> a list of <code>required_contexts</code> was defined which need to move into the <code>success</code> state in order to continue. For some reason, after <%= time_ago_in_words(AutoDeploymentWatchdogWorker::DEFAULT_DELAY.from_now) %> of waiting, at least one of these <code>required_contexts</code> are stuck in the <code>pending</code> state instead of transitioning to <code>success</code>, <code>failure</code>, or <code>error</code>. If you fix this issue your deployment will likely continue.</dd>
